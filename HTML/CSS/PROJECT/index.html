            <h2>A computer is a machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical<br>
                operations (computation) automatically.Modern digital electronic computers can perform generic<br>
                sets of operations known as programs. These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of<br>
                tasks. A computer system is a nominally complete computer that includes the hardware, operating <br>
                system (main software), and peripheral equipment needed and used for full operation. This term <br>
                may also refer to a group of computers that are linked and function together, such as a computer<br> 
                network or computer cluster.A broad range of industrial and consumer products use computers as c<br>
                ontrol systems. Simple special-purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls are incl
                uded, as are factory deviceslike industrial robotsand computer-aided design, as well as general
                purpose devices like personalcomputers ile devices like smartphones.Computerspower the 
                Internet, which links billions of other compersnd users.Early computers were meant to be used
                only for calculations.Simpl manual instruments t   like thabacus have aided people in doing calcu
                lations since ancient times. Early in the Industrial Revolution, some mechanical devices were bui
                lt to automate long, tedious tasks, such has a co as guiding patterns for looms. More sophisticated electrical
                machines did specialized analog calculations in the early 20th century. The first digital electronic
                calculating machines were developed during World War II. The first semiconductor transistors in the
                late 1940s were followed by the silicon-based MOSFET (MOS transistor) and monolithic integrated circuit
                chip technologies in the late 1950s, leading to the microprocessor and the microcomputer revolution in
                the 1970s. The speed, power and versatility of computers have been increasing dramatically ever since
                then, with transistor counts increasing at a rapid pace (as predicted by Moore's law), leading to the 
                Digital Revolution during the late 20th to early 21st centuries....<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer" target="_blank"><span>Read More</span></a>
